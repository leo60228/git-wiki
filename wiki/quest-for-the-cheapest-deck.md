title: The Quest for the Cheapest Deck
---
# Preface
I saw the Theme to Standard Imperial Command video, and I had 2 thoughts. First, $80 is a *lot* for the majority of new players, in the 8-12 age group, and with some thought it could easily get cheaper. 2nd, some cards could be replaced with "simpler" versions while remaining competitive, namely N. So, let’s start from the beginning, looking at what we have from the theme deck:

# Theme Deck
* 2x Empoleon
* 2x Prinplup
* 3x Piplup
* 2x Abomasnow
* 3x Snover
* 2x Alolan Sandslash
* 2x Alolan Sandshrew
* 2x Floatzel
* 2x Buizel
* 2x Manaphy
* 2x Corsola
* 1x Aqua Patch
* 1x Escape Board
* 1x Escape Rope
* 2x Hau
* 1x Lillie
* 2x Pokémon Fan Club
* 2x Professor Kukui
* 1x Rescue Stretcher
* 2x Sophocles
* 2x Timer Ball
* 1x Ultra Ball
* 20x Water Energy

# Trash
Next, let's sort out the trash cards:

* 2x Floatzel
* 2x Buizel
* 2x Manaphy
* 2x Corsola
* 2x Hau
* 2x Sophocles
* Total: 12

# Categories
Surprisingly few trash cards for a theme deck! Not like we'll be able to use all of the non-trash cards, but it's a good start. Now, let's sort the remainder into Attack, Consistency, and Other:

## Attack

* 2x Empoleon
* 2x Prinplup
* 3x Piplup
* 2x Professor Kukui
* Total: 9

## Consistency

* 2x Abomasnow
* 3x Snover
* 2x Alolan Sandslash
* 2x Alolan Sandshrew
* 1x Aqua Patch
* 1x Lillie
* 2x Pokémon Fan Club
* 2x Timer Ball
* 1x Ultra Ball
* Total: 17

## Other

* 1x Escape Board
* 1x Escape Rope
* 1x Rescue Stretcher
* Total: 3

# Cards from Imperial Command
We’ll want all of the trainers except a few where we need more space for new ones; all trainers that aren’t trash fit, and even the trash ones fit the theme of the deck. This really only became common in the Sun/Moon era, but it’s certainly nice. Sandslash is definitely necessary; it’s a somewhat worse, less random Octillery, and considering it’s free in this deck it’s an obvious inclusion. Empoleon is going in, obviously, since it’s the main attacker. That leaves Abomasnow; it *could* go in to fill the bench, but you should have backup attackers, whether they’re evolved or not, and it’s preferable to have 2 Sandslash. However, a 1-1 line helps fill the bench, especially since we don’t have Tapu Lele-GX. So, let’s look at our deck list so far:

## Pokémon

* 2x Empoleon
* 2x Prinplup
* 3x Piplup
* 1x Abomasnow
* 1x Snover
* 2x Alolan Sandslash
* 2x Alolan Sandshrew
* Total: 13

## Trainers:

* 1x Aqua Patch
* 1x Lillie
* 1x Pokémon Fan Club
* 2x Professor Kukui
* 1x Rescue Stretcher
* 1x Timer Ball
* 1x Ultra Ball
* 1x Escape Board
* 1x Escape Rope
* Total: 11

Grand Total: 25

# Increased Counts
25 cards isn’t even half a deck. However, we can get much closer by boosting counts of cards:

## Pokémon

* 4x Empoleon
* 3x Prinplup
* 4x Piplup
* 1x Abomasnow
* 1x Snover
* 2x Alolan Sandslash
* 2x Alolan Sandshrew
* Total: 17

## Trainers:

* 4x Aqua Patch
* 3x Lillie
* 1x Pokémon Fan Club
* 2x Professor Kukui
* 2x Rescue Stretcher
* 1x Timer Ball
* 4x Ultra Ball
* 2x Escape Board
* 1x Escape Rope
* Total: 22

Grand Total: 37

# Improving Trainers
We’re getting there! Now, let’s add some basic consistency trainers. We’ll also add 2 Wicke, as in the case of punishing overeager Ultra Balls, it can serve as a mini-N to prepare new players for higher level play. It can also be a hand-refresher if you have a hand you can’t play, and is much cheaper than N. We're using Random Receiver as a cheap alternative to more supporters; it should be swapped out for more supporters after rotation, but that shouldn’t happen before they have more cards. Lastly, we're adding some Rare Candies.  I’m using only 3 Cynthia, as Cynthia is the most expensive card in this deck.

## Pokémon

* 4x Empoleon
* 3x Prinplup
* 4x Piplup
* 1x Abomasnow
* 1x Snover
* 2x Alolan Sandslash
* 2x Alolan Sandshrew
* Total: 17

## Trainers:

* 4x Aqua Patch
* 3x Lillie
* 1x Pokémon Fan Club
* 2x Professor Kukui
* 2x Rescue Stretcher
* 1x Timer Ball
* 4x Ultra Ball
* 2x Escape Board
* 1x Escape Rope
* 3x Cynthia
* 2x Wicke
* 3x Rare Candy
* 3x Random Receiver
* Total: 31

Grand Total: 48

# Full List
This leaves us 12 spots for energy, and a very cheap deck that remains competitive! I’m using a 9/3 split of basic and Splash Energy, so that a Prinplup on the bench can be evolved immediately after getting knocked out. Splash Energy will rotate out, but is definitely a good card before then.

## Pokémon

* 4x Empoleon
* 3x Prinplup
* 4x Piplup
* 1x Abomasnow
* 1x Snover
* 2x Alolan Sandslash
* 2x Alolan Sandshrew
* Total: 17

## Trainers:

* 4x Aqua Patch
* 3x Lillie
* 1x Pokémon Fan Club
* 2x Professor Kukui
* 2x Rescue Stretcher
* 1x Timer Ball
* 4x Ultra Ball
* 2x Escape Board
* 1x Escape Rope
* 3x Cynthia
* 2x Wicke
* 3x Random Receiver
* 3x Rare Candy
* Total: 31

## Energy

* 9x Water Energy
* 3x Splash Energy
* Total: 12

Grand Total: 60

Boom! A 60 card deck. Now, what’s the cost breakdown?

# Closing
Now, we’re at the *very* manageable price of $28.16, with that going up to around $32 without a 20% off coupon on the theme deck. Nice! This deck is easy to suggest to new players, and allows them to try the competitive game without breaking the bank. One thing you may not have realized: swap out the evolution lines, and you have a viable Zoroark-GX / Greninja-GX deck, with an easy fit for a Greninja BREAK soft-tech! Swap out more than 1 trainer, and you can even make a Greninja BREAK deck by taking out the Alolan Sandslash, making this a great deck for later upgrades.
