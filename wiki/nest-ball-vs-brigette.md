title: Nest Ball vs Brigette
---
NOTE: This article does not count Prize Cards as it would make the calculations much more complex. I may redo the math in a spreadsheet.

## Premise
Most decks in 2017-2018 Standard want a Brigette turn 1. Assuming you always use it for 3 out of 4 specific Pokemon in your deck, and play 2 Lele, 4 Ultra Balls, and 1 Brigette, you have a 60% chance of using it turn 1. This takes your supporter for the turn, making you set up slower even though you have more Pokemon out. What do the chances change to if you play 3 Brigette (you can easily switch to 2), and 4 Nest Ball, and prefer searching for draw supporters to Brigette? This assumes you have 4 Professor Sycamore and 6 total shuffle and draw 6 supporters (N and Cynthia). I also count one of the target Pokemon as directly equivalent to a Nest Ball.

## Results
3+ Nest Ball: 3%
2+ Nest Ball: 23%
3+ Nest Ball after Sycamore: 6%
2+ Nest Ball after Sycamore: 28%
3+ Nest Ball after Cynthia/6 prize N: 2.6%
2+ Nest Ball after Cynthia/6 prize N: 18%
Cynthia/6 prize N with 3+ Nest Ball: 2%
Cynthia/6 prize N with 2+ Nest Ball: 14%
Sycamore with 3+ Nest Ball: 4%
Sycamore with 2+ Nest Ball: 21%
Total T1 3+ Nest Ball: 9%
**Total T1 2+ Nest Ball: 48%**
Total T1 3+ Nest Ball OR Brigette (32% chance): 38%
**Total T1 2+ Nest Ball OR Brigette (32% chance): 64%**

## Conclusion
While the added probability isn't high enough for it to always be better, if your deck has 4-6 free spaces, can handle playing 2 Pokemon instead of 3 on the 1st turn, the chances of hitting a T1 Brigette or 2+ Nest Ball are around the same or even slightly higher than a standard Brigette-based engine, with a 48% (standard Brigette is 60%) chance of being able to use a draw supporter instead of a setup-only one. For some decks, like Buzzwole-GX, this may be highly beneficial, as you have a much greater chance of fully setting up your main attacker on the 1st turn, while still having multiple ready to go on the bench.
