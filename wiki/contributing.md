This is a guide on how to contribute to TCGWiki.

1. Go to `https://leo60228.github.io/tcgwiki/wiki/`*`your page's name`* to make a new page OR click the edit button on an existing page.
1. You will be redirected to a Github login if you aren't logged in already. Create an account if you have not already.
1. Once you're on the edit screen, write your page in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
1. Once you've edited your page, save it.
1. Create a pull request, with an optional description. The page index is currently not automatically generated; I will add it if it is a new page (remind me if I don't).
1. The page is submitted to me for review.
